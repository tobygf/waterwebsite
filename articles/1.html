        <h1>What is DOC doing about the state of New Zealand’s rivers?</h1>

            DOC (the department of Conservation) has made it clear that they are concerned about the state of New Zealand’s rivers. According to a report published in 2011, they believe that “New Zealand is strongly influenced by rivers. They are central to the identity of many New Zealanders and are highly valued for their scenic and recreational qualities, as well as their economic potential.” It would appear that the the previous Government’s (and the current one’s) concern is a dual one. On the one hand, there is in New Zealand a sense that rivers are part of people; they form an essential part of “Kiwi culture”. This is important from both Pakeha and Maori perspectives: “For Māori, water is the essence of all life, akin to the blood of Papatuanuuku (Earth mother) who supports all people, plants and wildlife.” On the other hand, there is a utilitarian reason to want cleaner rivers, in the form of tourist dollars.
            </br>
            There are several potential legislative remedies to these issues. For example, under the National Parks Act 1980, most rivers within National Parks are subject to strict protection. This includes restrictions on the use and diversion of river water. The Reserves Act 1977 dictates that key parts of New Zealand’s landscape should be preserved to ensure it retains its “recognisable character”. According to the Department, this should include rivers. The Conservation Act 1987 says that indigenous freshwater fish should be entitled to special protections. The Freshwater Fisheries Regulations 1983 allows the Minister responsible for DOC (currently Eugenie Sage of the Green Party) to declare a given waterway to be a faunistic reserve, granting it greater protections. The main issue could be said to be an administrative one, not a legislative one - the groundwork is there.
            </br>
            The New Zealand Conservation Authority has issued the following recommendations:
            </br>
            <ul>
            <li>Protect outstanding rivers: DOC should ensure that those rivers that have not been significantly altered from their original state stay that way.</li>
            <li>Establish a network of protected rivers: A “representative network” of rivers that hold different types of value and face different challenges should be formed.</li>
            <li>Ensure water management properly reflects the conservation status of conservation land and the rivers within it: Rivers do not exist in a vacuum, and proper consideration should be given towards potential ramifications on other protected land and water.</li>
            <li>Indigenous biodiversity: New Zealand is evolutionarily unique, and our biodiversity should be protected with regulation.</li>
            <li>Protect Crown riverbeds: Crown riverbeds should be managed in a systematic manner with public consultation.</li>
            <li>Mechanisms in conservation legislation: Past legislation should be utilised to its fullest.</li>
            <li>Retain WCOs and improve their use: Water Conservation Orders should continue to be used, and their their power may even need expanding.</li>
            <li>Improve river management under the RMA: Regulations under the Resource Management Act should be standardised and improved.</li>
            </ul>

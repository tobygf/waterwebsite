        <p>
            One of the primary concerns in the field of river pollution is nitrate pollution. This is driven by nitrates entering water from farmed land. The more intensively an area of land is farmed, the worse the impact is.
            </br>
            Specific contaminants include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nitrogen</li>
            <li>Phosphorus</li>
            <li>Fine sediments</li>
            <li>Pesticides</li>
            <li>Heavy metals</li>
            <li>Pharmaceuticals</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../images/sign.jpg"></img>
        <p>
            Large bodies of water are more able to deal with these pollutants, as the contaminants can be more easily diluted. Some lakes can also combat pollution with the help of plants, which can process certain nutrients.
        </br>
            This issue might seem quite abstract, but it is having a profound impact on our freshwater fauna. A report found that almost three quarters of all native freshwater fish species are at some level of risk of extinction. This category of concern also extends to a third of both native freshwater invertebrates and native freshwater plants. This shows that this is not just an abstract, aesthetic issue; it is having a genuine impact.
